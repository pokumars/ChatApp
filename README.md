# ChatApp

<h2>Chat App description</h2>


This android application acts as a chat client for the accompanying chat server.<br>
With this you can communicate with other partcipants of the chat. This could<br>
be through the command line (using telnet) or this android app programme. This should be<br>
run using an emulator and not on your phone because the I.P address given into it<br>
is that of the emulator, not your phone. If you want to run it on your phone<br>
you have to change the i.p address of the server in 2 places  of the android programme<br>
to that of your pc or whatever device you use to run the server.<br>
